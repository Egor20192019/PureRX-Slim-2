                <p>Although the recipe for fat burning is simple, millions of people struggling with excess weight have not yet discovered it. Believe me, you also know this secret method!</p>
				<p>In my long career as a personal trainer, I have already helped hundreds of people. Today I want to share with you the fundamental principles that accompany the process of reducing body fat. If you have problems with weight loss, read the following article carefully, so that it will be permanently recorded in your memory.</p>
				<p>Effective weight loss</p>
				<p>The question that I want to explain to you at the very beginning is one of the most frequently asked questions accompanying weight loss. Namely - " what is more important-nutrition or physical activity?”. Any professional personal trainer or nutritionist will tell you that for people who want to get rid of excess pounds, the priority is not training, but food. Why is that?</p>
				<p>First-the basic principle of reduction-to lose weight you need to create a caloric deficit in the diet. It is no secret that it is much easier to create the above-mentioned deficit by limiting calories consumed than by increasing the duration of training sessions.</p>
				<p>Even if this is the only change you will make to your lifestyle, you will still start to lose weight-this is an indisputable law of physics. Someone who provides the body with fewer calories than it spends will always lose the energy accumulated in the body (in the form of fat).</p>
				<p>Of course, the pace of this process depends on many factors, and in the case of people suffering from hormonal or metabolic disorders-this process can be much more complex.</p>
				<p>Secondly, you will easily nullify the effects of the most intense training if you do not pay attention to what you eat.</p>
				<p>Referring to what I wrote above, if you consume more calories than you spent during the whole day (or week), this excess will begin to be postponed. Regardless of whether you spend millions on personal training with the best personal trainer-this is a sacred law of physics, it will always remain true.</p>
				<p>If you are hoping for real results, the first aspect that you need to take care of is the amount of energy supplied to the body. I really like to quote to my students a very accurate, English-language quote: "you can't out-train a bad diet.”.</p>
				<p>Perhaps it seems to you now that if you practice, you can afford much more than the average "blacksmith". I have prepared an interesting example for you:</p>
				<p>A woman aged about 25 years, who was just at the gym and trained, in my opinion, very intensively, for 45 minutes on the treadmill burned about 250kcal. The same woman, satisfied with her training, just walks past a well-known network selling coffee. It's summer so to cool off he orders a cold caramel frappuccino (380kcal). Not only that her whole workout (in terms of caloric balance) went to waste, she also gained 130kcal.</p>
				<p>I would like it to be clear and understandable for you that the movement itself will not lead to weight loss, contrary to what is written in industry magazines or heard from some "experts".</p>
				<p>Training is not a pass to eat without restrictions. The key to success in the aspect of reducing body fat is a properly balanced diet.</p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">

				<p>How to lose weight fast?</p>
				<p>Let's move on to the essence of this article IE permanently get rid of unnecessary kilograms? In theory, the secret to burning fat is to create a caloric deficit and maintain it until you reach your goals. Unfortunately, hormonal reactions and their effect on metabolism, accompanied by long-term caloric restriction, also come into play.</p>
				<p>The first thing you do is, like I wrote earlier, you reduce the number of calories you take in from food. Unfortunately, this deficit can not be too large, because it will negatively affect the rate of metabolism and the hormonal and immune system. In this aspect, many inexperienced personal trainers and self-trainers make the biggest mistake.</p>
				<p>The second thing is the right training. A good workout will allow you not only to increase a little caloric deficit but also positively affect the metabolic rate, insulin sensitivity and the appearance of the figure.Today, we will look at the second factor, which is training.</p>
				<p>We have a choice of three types of training:</p>
				<p>aerobic training is a type of activity with a light or medium intensity, during which oxygen changes occur in the body anaerobic training is an activity with a much higher intensity – such as strength training or interval training, there is also a third type, which is a combination of the two mentioned above-mixed training.</p>
			    <p>Interval training</p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/ito-3-3.png" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>For interval training you do not need any equipment, while the time of effort is very short and usually does not exceed 10-15 minutes. Interestingly, it gives excellent results in the form of burning fat and increasing endurance.</p>
				<p>Unlike traditional aerobic training, which burns fat only during exercise, interval training allows you to create so-called oxygen debt (EPOC), thereby increasing the metabolic rate by up to 15%. The burning of fat tissue then extends even to a few hours after the end of the training session.</p>
				<p>You can use any cardio machine, train in the field, or use your body weight by performing, for example, a series of push-ups or squats at a very fast pace.</p>
				<p>HIIT (high intensity interval training) is very tiring. In the beginning, start with 1-2 sessions per week. Perform them only on days off from other forms of activity and preferably in the morning, because this type of exercise causes a fairly large ejection of cortisol and catecholamines.</p>
				<p>Interval training Plan</p>
				<p>When planning interval training, we must take into account three basic factors-the length of the effort, the length of the breaks and the proportions between them. At the beginning, I propose to keep the proportions of 3: 1 (work: rest), but as the strength increases, gradually reduce this difference, reaching the target of 1: 1. Always start with a gentle warm-up lasting 3-5 minutes.</p>
				<p>How does it look in practice?</p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/ito-3-4.png" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Perform 20s of high activity: for twenty seconds, perform a very exhausting exercise, for example, very fast running (sprint), burpees, half squats with a jump, etc.</p>
				<p>The activity is followed by 60s of moderate activity: for sixty seconds, perform a low-intensity exercise, e.g., trucht in place, walk around the room, etc.</p>
				<p>Perform 6 – 8 such intervals and finish with 3-5 minute silencing exercises, e.g. walking.</p>
				<p>You can modify the number of intervals, their duration and the ratio of high activity to low activity depending on your level of training. I suggest you start with 6 rounds and gradually increase the number to 8 or even 12. High activity usually lasts from 10 to 20 seconds in the case of sprints, or from 60 to 90 seconds in the case of slightly less exhausting exercises.</p>
				<p>Strength training and fat reduction</p>
				<p>The main reason why resistance training helps to lose weight is the fact that it is accompanied by a large expenditure of energy and recomposition of body composition.</p>
				<p>If you perform multi – step exercises such as squats, squats, rowing, pull-ups or deadlifts, you not only create a caloric deficit and affect metabolism but also strengthen and build muscle-so the body looks more athletic.</p>
				<p>In addition, your body uses a very large portion of energy to restore microtraumas of muscle fibers after a workout.</p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/ito-3-5.png" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>You want to lose weight? Do you need help with your training?</p>
				<p>At each training session, I propose to train the whole body (fbw) three times a week, making sure that the sessions do not take place day after day.</p>
				<p>You can choose, for example, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, or Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Choose the load so that the execution of the intended number of repetitions is a problem for you, but so that at the same time you are able to perform the exercise taking care of the correct technique.</p>
				<p>If you easily finish the last repetition, it means that you should increase the weight. Perform the exercises in a circular form, that is, one after the other with about a 60-second break between each of them. Make 3 such circuits.</p>
				<p>Training Plan for weight loss</p>
				<p>A1. Barbell prints (3 x 10 – 15 repetitions)</p>
				<p>Holding the barbells in both hands, make a step forward so that one leg is behind and the other is in front. Lower the body, bringing the knee of the sacrum leg to the ground. Return to starting position. The outstretched leg should remain slightly bent to maintain muscle tension.</p>
				<p>A2. One-handed barbell rowing (3 x 10 – 15 repetitions)</p>
				<p>Hold the barbell in your right hand and lean your left hand on the bench so that your torso is parallel to the ground. Pull the barbell hanging in the straightened hand to the height of the waist. Keep your back straight while doing this exercise. Slowly lower the barbell until you completely straighten your arm. Change your arm and repeat the exercise.</p>
				<p>A3. Romanian deadlift with barbells (3 x 10 – 15 repetitions)</p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/ito-3-6.png" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				
				<p>Hold the barbells with both hands facing the body. Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart. Slowly begin to push your hips back, keeping the curvature of your spine neutral. Bend your knees slightly and, keeping the barbells close to your body, deepen the bend so that the weights are closer to the ground. Strain the muscles of the body and maintain the natural position of the spine, which means straight back. Don't go round the front. Return to the upright position, slowly directing the hips forward.</p>
				<p>A4. Bench press (3 x 10 – 15 repetitions)</p>
				<p>Grab the barbells in both hands and lie on your back on the bench. Start by straightening your arms above your chest. Pull the shoulder blades together to create a stable position for the shoulders. Lower the barbells so that they are on both sides of the trunk and then return to the starting position.</p>
				<p>A5. Pushing the barbell over the head (3 x 10 – 15 repetitions)</p>
				<p>Take some barbells and sit on the edge of the bench. Start by raising your hands to shoulder height. Push the barbells over your head until your shoulders are almost straight. Slowly lower your hands to the starting position. You can also perform this exercise standing up.</p>
				<p>A6. Plank (3 x 15 – 60 seconds)</p>
				<p>Lie on your stomach on the exercise mat. Rise on your forearms and position your body parallel to the ground from your head to your feet. Keep your figure erect a few inches above the floor. If this version is too difficult for you and you feel that your torso is sinking to the ground, then start by placing your arms on the bench.</p>
				<p>Think of this resistance training as a starting point. Each exercise program is subject to modifications as you become stronger and better able to cope with the technique of the exercises.</p>
				<p>It is possible that at some point you will begin to perform other weekly sets divided into several sessions. The training that you received from me will symmetrically develop your body and help you get rid of unnecessary pounds, as long as your diet is properly selected.</p>
				<p>Mixed training and weight loss</p>
				<p>A great strategy if your goal is primarily to get rid of excess pounds, will be the use of mixed training.</p>
				<p>Mixed training involves first doing an anaerobic workout – such as the interval or strength training mentioned above – and then, at the end of the anaerobic session, adding aerobic exercise (e.g. walking on a treadmill in the range of ~125-135 BPM).</p>
				<p>This approach allows the oxidation (oxidation / burning) of fat released during an anaerobic session.</p>
				<p>Summary</p>

				<p>Weight loss – the most important facts</p>
				<p>Today we discussed the three most important training methods that will allow you to improve your figure. You've gained the basic knowledge you need to get started.</p>
				<p>As part of this short summary, I present you a training plan for the whole week:</p>
				<p>Monday: resistance training of the whole body,</p>
				<p>Tuesday: interval training,</p>
				<p>Wednesday: resistance training of the whole body,</p>
				<p>Thursday: interval training,</p>
				<p>Friday: resistance training of the whole body,</p>
				<p>Saturday: light activity (family walk),</p>
				<p>Sunday: free.</p>
				<p>Remember-always listen to your body, if so far you have not trained at all, then start with fewer workouts. If you feel that your body does not regenerate properly between training sessions, then also reduce the amount or volume of training.</p>
				<p>If you do everything correctly, and the results are still not there-then there is a good chance that you suffer from metabolic or hormonal problems, and in this case you should consult an experienced personal trainer.</p>
