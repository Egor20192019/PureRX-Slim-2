				<p>If we consume too much sugar the body sends us unequivocal signals that it is good not to underestimate: dull skin, fatigue, caries, high blood sugar, hypertension and not only. Here are the obvious signs that you are eating too much sugar!</p>
				<p>Everyone likes sugar, even those who would say no: it is in fact present not only in candies, donuts and various sweets, but in many unsuspected foods such as minestrone, breaded foods, cold cuts, bread in boxes and other processed products, which we consume almost every day and which contain hidden sugars. When we take too much sugar, however, the body sends us unequivocal signals: chronic fatigue, dull skin, weight gain, high blood sugar, hypertension, up to depression, all this makes it necessary to drastically reduce its consumption. Unfortunately it is not always an easy task, because sugars create a real addiction, but in the presence of some symptoms it is good to change your eating habits. Here is then what happens if you take too much sugar: the signals not to be underestimated.</p>
				<p>How much sugar to consume per day?</p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/ito-1-2.png" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>According to the World Health Organization, only 5% of the calories we take every day should come from added sugars. The maximum would then be 6 teaspoons of sugar per day, which could correspond to a 250 ml bottle of sweetened lemon tea. Now let's see what are the signs that make us realize that we're overdoing it with the intake of sugars, so as to implement strategies to reduce dramatically the consumption of: to understand which products are present in large quantities, always read the ingredients list and limit consumption of packaged foods and processed, in favor of fresh produce and lean proteins.</p>
				<p>1.Dull skin and the appearance of acne</p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/ito-1-3.png" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>One of the first signs of excessive sugar consumption is visible on our skin that can appear dull and dull, with the appearance of pimples or mild acne. Too much sugar, in fact, contributes to an imbalance of hormones during the menstrual cycle. Sugar, in addition, damages the production of collagen and elastin resulting in the appearance of premature wrinkles and premature aging of the skin. Therefore, also pay attention to the signals that your skin sends you, especially if you notice sudden and sudden changes.</p>
				<p>2.Chronic fatigue and depression risk</p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/ito-1-4.png" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>If during the day we consume mainly foods that contain sugar, but without protein, fiber and fat, we will find ourselves in the middle of the afternoon tired: sugar causes a momentary peak of energy that after a short time is drastically reduced reaching levels below normal. Often you try to overcome this lack of energy with the consumption of carbonated drinks or stimulants that do nothing but increase this vicious circle: better take a coffee without sugar or with natural sweeteners, which will allow you to recover energy, or eat an apple that also contains fiber, which promote the digestion of sugars.</p>
				<p>The more we eat sugar and the more we want it, so when we miss it we are sadder or anyway, our unmore gets worse. A high-sugar diet then causes high peaks of inflammation throughout the body: this is also linked to depression.</p>
				<p>3.High bad cholesterol and hypertension</p>
				<p>Another signal of excessive sugar consumption is the increase in certain fats in the blood: this can lead to a reduction in good cholesterol (HDL) and an increase in bad cholesterol (LDL). According to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, fructose could stimulate the body to develop triglycerides and bad cholesterol. Blood pressure could also be affected by the overabundance of sugar that could cause hypertension: sugars require greater caediacal effort, as it is more difficult to metabolize, for this the pressure values increase.</p>
				<p>4. Uncontrollable craving for sweets and weight gain</p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/ito-1-5.png" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>Sugar has effects very similar to those of drugs: for this reason the uncontrollable urge to eat sweets indicates an excessive consumption of sugars. Always human beings have a need glucose to survive, so the more we eat, the more our brain drives us to be damaged: this is why sugar is also found in foods unexpected such as meat, sauces, frozen food, etc... Eat so many sweets does not feel satiated, as the sugar activates the same mechanisms of other foods, such as those rich in fiber, increase satiety, what drives us to eat more. In addition, once the brain has received the necessary amount of sugar to function properly, our body metabolizes it as fat. Prefer the consumption of fruit: the glucose it is rich in, in fact, is not as harmful as that present in sweets and industrial products.</p>
				<p>5. Appearance of caries</p>
				<p>Foods rich in sugars then favor the appearance of caries: when the bacteria present in our mouth assimilate carbohydrates, they produce an acid that when combined with saliva causes the formation of plaque. If the teeth are not washed right away, the stage accumulates, eroding the enamel, starting the formation of caries. It is therefore important to always brush your teeth after meals and encourage the consumption of low-sugar foods, which help us keep our teeth healthy.</p>
				<p>6. High blood sugar with diabetes risk</p>
				<figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                  <div><img src="images/ito-1-6.png" alt=""></div>
                </figure>
				<p>When the amount of glucose in the blood exceeds the permissible levels, you have hyperglycemia: that is, high blood sugar. The origin of glucose is food, but also muscles and liver. If your blood sugar stays high for a few hours, you may experience dehydration that could damage your kidneys, arteries and brain. If your blood sugar stays high for weeks, you are most likely to have diabetes. For this it is important to know what we eat, paying attention to the ingredients, reducing those that contain many sugars and consulting the doctor to keep the values under control.</p>
